# Shazam_demo(Spark)

This is a really facinating project, which simulates exactly what Shazam app does using pySpark.

In case you don't know Shazam, it is an App which can help you find a Song using a short Snippet of Song. 

The trick in the code is using hashing, for more details, please refer to the code in assn3_shazam.ipynb.
